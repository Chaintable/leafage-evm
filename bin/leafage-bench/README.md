# leafage-bench

Benchmark CLI for comparing `eth_call` performance between **leafage-evm** and **geth**.

---

## Corpus

The benchmark corpus (`corpus/corpus.json`) is a curated set of real-world `eth_call` requests
collected from production mirror traffic, de-hotspotted, and balanced across three complexity tiers
(L1 / L2 / L3) to ensure a fair and reproducible comparison.

The file is tracked via **Git LFS**. After cloning the repository, pull the corpus data with:

```bash
git lfs pull
```

If Git LFS is not installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

## How `corpus.json` Was Collected

The corpus was derived from live production `eth_call` traffic captured via HTTP traffic mirroring.
Raw mirror records were parsed to extract embedded JSON-RPC requests (`eth_call`,
`contractMultiCall`, and similar batch methods), which were then exploded into individual
`eth_call` cases and normalised.

To remove hotspot bias — where a single `(selector, contract)` pair can represent 90 %+ of all
production requests — two deterministic capping passes were applied:

- **Group cap**: at most 20 cases per `(label, selector, contract)` group.
- **Selector cap**: at most 300 cases per `(label, selector)` bucket.

After de-hotspotting, a fixed quota was drawn from each complexity tier (L1 / L2 / L3) to form
the final balanced corpus.

## Traffic Classification: L1 / L2 / L3

Every case in the corpus carries a `classification.label` field (`L1`, `L2`, or `L3`).
The label reflects the **execution complexity** of the `eth_call` request, assigned by a
signal-based scoring model.

### Score model

Each request starts at score `0`. Signals add or subtract points:

| Signal | Score delta | Condition |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `light-selector` | −3 | Selector is a known cheap getter (`balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `decimals`, `symbol`, `name`, `implementation`) |
| `calldata-4b` | −2 | Calldata is exactly 4 bytes (selector only, no arguments) |
| `calldata-36b` | −1 | Calldata is 36 bytes (selector + one `address` or `uint256` argument) |
| `calldata-68b+` | +2 | Calldata ≥ 68 bytes (two or more arguments) |
| `calldata-100b+` | +1 | Calldata ≥ 100 bytes |
| `calldata-132b+` | +1 | Calldata ≥ 132 bytes (three or more arguments) |
| `has-from` | +1 | Request includes a `from` field (state-dependent call) |
| `portfolio-tag` | +1 | Request originated from a `portfolio` scenario |
| `token-balance-tag` | −1 | Request originated from a `token_balance` scenario |

### Label assignment

| Score | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| ≤ −2 | **L1** | **Lightweight read.** Simple getter with no or one argument, or a known cheap selector (`balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `decimals`, etc.). Minimal EVM execution; result is typically a single storage slot read. |
| −1 … +1 | **L2** | **Medium complexity.** Unknown or moderately complex selector, standard view call with one or two arguments. Represents the bulk of typical DeFi read traffic. |
| ≥ +2 | **L3** | **Heavy call.** Long calldata, state-dependent call (includes `from`), or a complex view function such as Uniswap V3 `slot0`, liquidity calculations, or portfolio aggregation queries. Exercises the EVM execution path most deeply. |

### Corpus composition (`corpus.json`)

| Label | Cases | Unique selectors | Unique contracts |
|-------|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| L1 | 300 | ~21 | ~63 |
| L2 | 300 | ~38 | ~246 |
| L3 | 100 | ~13 | ~62 |
| **Total** | **700** | | |

The 700-case balanced corpus is sufficient for a first-version benchmark that reliably detects
performance differences of 5 %+ between leafage-evm and geth.
